# Reusable Blood Transfusion Set â€“ Handoff Documentation

This repository contains all files related to the development and handoff of a reusable blood transfusion set for the Pothawira Surgical Center in Malawi. The goal of this project is to provide a cost-effective, sterilizable, and sustainable solution to address critical blood transfusion needs in low-resource settings.  
It is intended as a resource and starting point for future teams at the Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences (MUBAS) and other collaborators working to continue and improve the project.
